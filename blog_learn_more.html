                        <h2>TOKENIZING EQUITY IN GCC EARLY STAGE VENTURES</h2>
                        <p>The greatest deterrent to venture investing as an asset class is an excruciatingly long
                            investment
                            holding period of five to seven years. Tokenization, a process of digitally representing
                            assets
                            including shares in a company by recording them on blockchain, intends to solve this problem
                            thereby
                            unlocking liquidity premium for early stage companies.
                            <br>
                            Whilst a complete data set on GCC early stage investment returns is not available, it is not
                            unreasonable to surmise that early stage investors would ideally be looking to improve
                            returns
                            by
                            hunting for opportunities with lower fees and a higher probability of early exits. With
                            Securities
                            Token Offerings (STOs) becoming a reality in the GCC, investors would be able to gain access
                            to
                            a
                            wider suite of deal flow, and save on fees.

                            Regulators - Key players in the development of tokenized offerings
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            In the UAE, Abu Dhabi Global Markets (ADGM), has issued Guidance on Regulation of Digital
                            Securities
                            Activity in ADGM[1] confirming that digital assets with features and characteristics of a
                            security
                            are regarded as ‘Digital Securities’. The Guidance is intended to assist entities seeking to
                            utilise
                            new technologies (such as Distributed Ledger Technology) for the purpose of expanding their
                            activities from the more conventional securities to digital securities.
                            <br>
                            Additionally, the Central Bank of Bahrain issued ‘Equity Crowdfunding’ regulations in 2017,
                            allowing
                            the creation of platforms for early stage ventures in order to raise capital from investors.
                            It
                            has
                            further issued ‘Crypto Asset’ regulations that cover trading, dealing, advisory and
                            portfolio
                            management services in payment tokens, but not securities tokens.
                            <br>
                            Whilst the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) has also issued investment crowdfunding
                            regulations, according to the 2018 DFSA annual report, the authority is considering its
                            approach
                            to
                            the regulation of digital assets (including crypto-currencies and tokenised securities),
                            with
                            respect to trading, storage, and marketing of these instruments. These regulations, when
                            issued,
                            will provide an impetus for issuances of STOs in, and from, the Dubai International
                            Financial
                            Centre.
                            <br>
                            Recently, the Securities and Commodities Authority (SCA) in the UAE posted draft regulations
                            concerning crypto assets and requested feedback from participants in the ecosystem. The
                            regulations
                            will encompass all aspects of crypto asset industry ranging from token issuance requirements
                            to
                            trading and safekeeping practices.

                            Transparency, liquidity and access to deal flow – critical factors for investor community
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            MENA (Middle East and North Africa) has witnessed a Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of
                            23%
                            from
                            2013-2018 in the value of early stage technology deals, whilst the overall number of deals
                            has
                            shown
                            only a CAGR of 9.5% over the same period[2]. In order to lend more thrust to this growth,
                            the
                            region
                            needs platforms offering issuers, particularly in the pre-seed and seed stages, the ability
                            to
                            raise
                            funds from a wide spectrum of investors reducing their fundraising cost and time, as well as
                            providing deal flow to investors.
                            <br>
                            Fund raising taking place through regulated platforms, such as equity crowdfunding portals,
                            typically provide reasonably extensive disclosures (although not to the extent of IPO
                            issuances).
                            Bahrain[3] for instance, has requirements of issuers to file an offering statement
                            (containing
                            the
                            issuer’s business plan, management information, risk factors, and historical financial
                            statements)
                            with the crowdfunding operator. DFSA, on the other hand, casts the obligation on the
                            crowdfunding
                            platform to disclose information on the issuers clearly on their websites. With the quality
                            of
                            information available to the investment community continuously improving as a result of
                            regulations,
                            the GCC region is poised to witness a growth in early stage issuances.
                            <br>
                            Bahrain and UAE[4] have taken the lead in becoming the hub for cryptocurrencies and digital
                            assets,
                            hopefully paving the way for STO issuances and their listings on exchanges. The exchange
                            infrastructure gradually being put in place, with regulations on digital assets expected to
                            come
                            soon, augurs well for tokenization of equities in the GCC, solving the liquidity problem of
                            venture
                            investors. Recently, a Bahrain-based cryptocurrency exchange, Rain, was announced to be the
                            first
                            fully regulated, onshore cryptocurrency exchange in MENA, having acquired the Crypto-Asset
                            Module
                            regulatory license from the Central Bank of Bahrain. Similarly, ADGM granted in-principle
                            approvals
                            to crypto asset exchanges such as BitOasis, MidChains and Arabian Bourse.
                            <br>
                            Tokenization of equities takes democratization of investments one step forward by providing
                            the
                            wider investor community a strong prospect of liquidity, unlocking significant value for
                            entrepreneurs. With regulators across the GCC working intensely in continuing to develop
                            policies,
                            it may not be too long before we witness digital shares of early stage ventures being
                            traded.
