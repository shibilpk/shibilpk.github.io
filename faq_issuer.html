                                Services Authority (“DFSA”) (as defined in the glossary). Bambucorn currently has an
                                in-principle
                                approval from the DFSA for an Innovation Testing License (“ITL”). Bambucorn is currently

                                under ITL to testing its platform and due to the limited nature of the ITL, normal

                                What is Tokenization?

                                In the context of Bambucorn, tokenization refers to the process of digitally
                                representing an
                                investment. When investors subscribe to a particular investment opportunity by signing
                                the
                                Investment Subscription Agreement (“ISA”) and transfer the amount, investors will be
                                issued a token
                                that represents their ownership of shares of the underlying company. By virtue of
                                holding the token,
                                investors will retain all economic, voting and other rights associated with the
                                ownership of the
                                underlying shares.

                                Why tokenization and not a normal issuance of shares?

                                Tokenization will allow investors to sell their tokens on regulated Security Token
                                Exchanges (STEs),
                                thus increasing liquidity for their investments and providing a price-discovery
                                mechanism. These
                                benefits may likely result in a higher valuation for start-ups in subsequent rounds of
                                fundraising.

                                No, all issuers must issue tokens. Issuance of tokens is akin to the issuance of shares.
                                The only
                                difference is that the issuance of tokens allows investors to realize the value of their
                                investment
                                much earlier. Issuers will need to ensure that their jurisdiction of incorporation
                                allows for
                                issuance of tokens.

                                your bank account. In return for the money, the issuer will issue tokens and the name(s)
                                of the token holder(s) will be recorded on your register of shareholders. Once the token

                                solution to monitor the identity of the token holders. This cap table will be updated in
                                real-time.
